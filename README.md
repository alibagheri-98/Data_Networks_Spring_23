# Data_Networks_Spring_23
In this repository, you will find two homework assignments related to Data Networks that I developed during my time as a teaching assistant for the Data Networks course, taught by Dr. Pakravan at Sharif University during the Spring of 2023. These assignments are divided as follows:

- Homework 1: Focusing on questions related to the physical layer.
- Homework 2: Comprising questions pertaining to the datalink layer.

Additionally, within the "Supplementary" folder, you can access further questions from my role as a teaching assistant during the Fall 2022 and Spring 2022 semesters for the Data Networks course, taught by Dr. Pakravan at Sharif University. Moreover, questions from the Fall 2021 semester are also available. During that term, I personally took the "Data Networks" course, which was instructed by Dr. Pakravan at Sharif University of Technology. However, I have chosen not to include these in my CV to maintain brevity.

## Course syllabus:
- Introduction
- The Physical Layer
